# ft_printf

The project "ft_printf" aims to recreate the functionality of the standard C library function "printf()". The task involves writing a function that takes in a format string and a variable number of arguments, formats them according to the format string, and outputs the result to the standard output stream.

Through this project, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the workings of the "printf()" function and how to handle variable arguments in C. I had to ensure that my function was able to handle a wide range of format specifiers, such as strings, characters and integers, and hexadecimal notation numbers, as well as special flags and modifiers that affect the output formatting.
